# Steps:
# Repository created
1. create repository on git-hub and make it public.
[LAB_mst]( https://github.com/22bdo10074/MST_1)
2. Add remote and then pull on local repository.
  ### git command:
  $ git remote add origin https://github.com/22bdo10074/MST_1.git
  $ git push -u origin master
3. Adding Collaborators:
   On GitHub, go to the repository settings and navigate to "Collaborators".
   Add other group members by their usernames.
4. Cloning the Repository:
   On each member's machine, open a terminal and navigate to their desired directory.
    Clone the repository using the URL:   
  ### git command:
  git clone https://github.com/22bdo10074/MST_1.git
5. Verifying Local Repository:
   git status
6. Local Commit and Push: 

o Make a change (e.g., edit a file).

o Stage the changes: git add <filename> (or git add . for all changes)

o Commit the changes with a message: git commit -m "<message>"

o Push the commit to the remote repository: git push

o Verifying Pushed Commit:

### git command:
    git pull

7.Check the commit history using:git log
SHA-1 Consistency:

### Observe the commit SHA-1 hash in the git log output. This hash is unique and consistent across all repositories due to Git's content addressing.
8.Racing Commits and Merge:
o Make a local edit (e.g., modify a file).

o Make a local edit in a different file (crucial to avoid immediate conflict).

o Commit and push: git commit -m "<message>" && git push

o Attempt to push: git push (This will fail due to out-of-date local repository)

9.Pull, Merge Conflict, and Resolution:

### git command:
Run: git pull

This will initiate a merge and potentially encounter a conflict (if edits overlap).

The conflicted file will be highlighted with markers.

Manually edit the file to resolve the conflict (choose desired changes).

Stage the fix: git add <filename>

Commit the resolved conflict: git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict"
